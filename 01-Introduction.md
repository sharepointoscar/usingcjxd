    ## From zero to superhero with CloudBees Jenkins X Distribution

# What is Jenkins X CloudBees Distribution?

Jenkins X CloudBees Distribution (CJXD), is merely a snapshot of all the OSS available to you via Github.  CloudBees decided (and rightfully so), that enterprise environments and others needed a more stable version or release.  Typically environments have change management and other processes in place, and are careful on introducing new versions of applications to avoid disruption.

Enter CJXD which solves this problem and provides easy of mind, yet leverages the power of Kubernetes native CI/CD.
